# Mandelbrot Set Visualizer

This project serves as a way to view the [mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) by providing a way to pan over the set and zoom into desired sections. 
The code leverages multithreading capabilities to run significantly faster on multicore machines, allowing the long, tedious calculations to be done faster.

To use, simply install the Mandelbrot.jar file and run it.
